Every time I read this phrase, it makes me introspect immediately, questioning myself with where am I, what am I doing, what do I have, what do I want and most importantly why.


I feel it resonates with all of us deeply. I am a cent percent sure, at some point of time we have had inclination to want more than we already have, whether as kids we cried for the exact same toy as our friend, convinced theirs was better than ours, or as college students not enjoying our branch and always contemplating I wish I had taken that branch at that university at that time.


But we can’t change the choices we have already made, can we? This reminds me of a beautiful quote by Jim Carrey

Recall the moment you achieved something you had a yen for. It was most certainly followed by a period of feeling ecstatic and some celebrations. But how long did it last? Did you stop desiring after that?


They say desires are like the limitless sky, they are equal to the drops in the ocean or leaves on the planet. While it’s not unfavourable to have better standards of living, but have you ever wondered what after that?


You get your dream college but soon start worrying about internships, projects, grades and what not. You get the job you always dreamed of having, but then soon start working hard to get the promotion. It is our very nature to aspire, either to prove ourselves, to get social validation or cause we believe life will be perfect after accomplishing this goal. All this is okay, but the more we rely on external factors for happiness, the greater our urge, cravings and covets for materialistic objects becomes.


The impermanence of contentment and short lived satisfaction makes me appreciate and develop gratitude for everything I am so blessed to have. We all remorse about what has already happened and worry about what is going to, throwing away the precious time in our hands to live in the present. Stop for a moment in this mad race of achieving success cause there is never enough ;)
