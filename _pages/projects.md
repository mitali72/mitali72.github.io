## Interests

I am interested in areas of systems, cloud and serverless computing, virtualization, machine learning and intersection of these. Currently, I am doing Research and Development under on performance characterization of software assisted GPU scheduling and scheduling in FaaS platforms for GPU functions with variants.


I am also working in areas of speech processing, improving the preprocessing stages that heavily affect accuracy and model design decisions of ML based speech applications.

			<h3>Speech processing</h3>
			<p>As part of my B.Tech. Project with <a href = "https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/prao" style="color:#ff2957;">Prof. Preeti Rao</a>, I am working towards testing the existing methods for preprocessing pipeline on news broadcast audios of low resource languages and improving them for use in ML based speech to text translation models</p>

			<h3>SElf DRiving CAr</h3>
			<p>Sedrica is a student led technical team developing India's first self driving car with level 5 autonomy. I worked in the computer vision subsystem for about a year and developed a multi-task learning model for jointly performing object detection and road segmentation and significantly reducing computation costs on limited GPU memory.</p>

			<h3>Automatic Speech Recognition</h3>
            <p>As part of my course work CS753 - Automatic Speech Recognition under Hacker role, we implemented the paper <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03256.pdf" style="color:#ff2957;">Right2Talk</a> on main speaker identification and localization using audio-visual transformers. I also performed transfer learning on Coqui English STT model for building ASR systems on Indian languages on extremely small dataset.

			<h3>Low Light Image Enhancement</h3>
			<p>We all have faced that situation when we wished we could somehow make the night images brighter or enhance images captured under low light conditions while ensuring they look natural. This motivated me to implement and compare different low light image enhancement techniques in my Image Processing course project. Details in report.</p>

			<h3>Bosch's Traffic Sign Recognition Challenge</h3>
			<p>Won bronze out of 23 teams that participated in Inter IIT Tech Meet 2021. The problem statement involved creating a no code UI for all the stages of ML pipeline while also providing intelligent solutions to the user for explaining failures of the system. I particularly worked on backened, trainging different models on the challenge dataset and implementing different techniques of visualization for model explainability.</p>
