## interests
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: justify"> 
My research is motivated by the spectacular organismal diversity across the tree of life and aims at understanding how phenotypic variation emerges and how it is maintained in spatially or temporally variable environments. 
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: justify; padding-top:7px"> 
Specifically, I am studying how trajectories of phenotypic evolution in natural populations are shaped by selection for combinations of traits (correlational selection) across multiple environmental gradients.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: justify; padding-top:7px">
Moreover, I am investigating how such environmental gradients can lead to alternative developmental trajectories (developmental plasticity), and how they may affect speed and direction of evolutionary change.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
My overarching research goal is to understand both ultimate and proximate causes of phenotypic variation within and across natural populations.
</p>

## methods
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: justify; padding-top:7px"> 
Throughout my career I have used a variety of invertebrate model systems to investigate the causes of variation in morphology, phyisology and behaviour with controlled laboratory experiments, large scale outdoor mesocosm experiments, and field surveys. 
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0px; text-align: justify"> 
To uncover the causal links between genotypes, environmental factors, and phenotypes, I am collecting high dimensional phenotypic (phenomic) data in high throughput using computer vision (the automated extraction of meaningful information from digital images).

		<h3>Trophic diversification of Lake Victoria Cichlids</h3>
		<img src="/assets/images/cichlid_teeth.png" />
		<p> It took less than 15000 years for several hundred species of haplochromine cichlid species to evolve from a common ancestor within Lake Victoria. I am using computer vision to construct a classifier to map fossil teeth onto teeth from contemporary trophic guilds to investigate the speed and order of their emergence.</p>

		<h3>Determinants of temporal variation in aquatic ecosystem</h3>
		<img src="/assets/images/experiments/ponds1.jpg" />
		<p> Submerged macrophytes are important foundation species that can influence the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems over time and govern the response to perturbation. In a series of large scale outdoor experiments we quantified ecosystem effects of macrophytes using cutting-edge high frequency measurement technology.</p>
