:point_right: The goal of my science is to understand both ultimate and proximate causes of phenotypic variation within and across natural populations.
</p>

## interests
I am interested in patterns and processes that give rise to phenotypic variation in natural populations over ecological timescales. Specifically, I study how phenotypes are shaped by complex selection scenarios, such as selection for combinations of traits (correlational selection) or modularization (phenotypic integration). 

Moreover, I am investigating how variation in the environmental experienced during early life stages can lead to alternative developmental trajectories (developmental plasticity), and how this may affect speed and direction of evolutionary change, for example, by selecting for plastic responses to variation of the environment (adaptive plasticity).

## methods

Throughout my career I have used a variety of  aquatic invertebrate model systems to investigate the causes of variation in morphology, phyisology and behaviour with controlled laboratory experiments, outdoor mesocosm experiments, and field surveys. This includes stone corals (Scleractinia), marine and freshwater amphipods (Amphipoda) and isopods (Isopoda), and, currently, damselflies and dragonflies (Odonata). 

To uncover the causal links between genotypes, environmental factors, and multivariate phenotypes, I am collecting high dimensional phenotypic (phenomic) data in high throughput using computer vision; the automated extraction of meaningful information from digital images. To that end I employ a combination of techniques, ranging from semi-manual signal processeing to deep learning.

		<h3>Trophic diversification of Lake Victoria Cichlids</h3>
		<img src="/assets/images/cichlid_teeth.png" />
		<p> It took less than 15000 years for several hundred species of haplochromine cichlid species to evolve from a common ancestor within Lake Victoria. I am using computer vision to construct a classifier to map fossil teeth onto teeth from contemporary trophic guilds to investigate the speed and order of their emergence.</p>

		<p> Submerged macrophytes are important foundation species that can influence the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems over time and govern the response to perturbation. In a series of large scale outdoor experiments we quantified ecosystem effects of macrophytes using cutting-edge high frequency measurement technology.</p>
