            <h3>Microsoft: May'22 - July'22</h3>
            <p> I worked with Digital Security and Resilience team at Microsoft India on intelligent attribution of control failures. My work involved querying millions of data records for dynamic feature extraction, designing and implementation of a scoring heuristic and finally deployment on a queue triggered Azure Function App. Recently, I also wrote a <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/course/~eesa/blogs/EEntern/eeb1.html" style="color:#ff2957;">blog </a> on my interview and internship experiences for EE Student Association website.

            <h3>Fraazo: Dec'21</h3>
            <p> Fraazo is one of the best thing that happened in my life <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span>. Working at Fraazo, a D2C delivery startup for fresh farm produce serving ~200k households was a very exciting experience. The energy and work culture at Fraazo was very different from other internships. I worked there as a backened engineer to develop new internal APIs as well as improve efficiency of existing ones using Ruby on Rails and Active Record Query Interface.
